## What is Sujood?

Sujood (prostration) is one of the fundamental postures in Islamic prayer (salah). It is the act of placing one's forehead, nose, both hands, knees, and toes on the ground while facing the Qibla (direction of Mecca). 

Sujood is considered the position where a Muslim is closest to Allah, making it a moment of deep humility and spiritual connection. During this posture, specific duas and dhikr (remembrance of Allah) are recited.

### Key aspects of Sujood:

- **Physical position**: Forehead and nose touching the ground, hands placed flat beside the head
- **Spiritual significance**: The closest position to Allah during prayer
- **Frequency**: Performed twice in each rakah (unit) of prayer
- **Duration**: Each sujood should last long enough to recite the required dhikr at least three times

The duas recited during sujood are acts of glorification, seeking forgiveness, and expressing submission to Allah.
