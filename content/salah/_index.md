## What is Salah?

Salah is the Islamic ritual prayer performed five times daily by Muslims worldwide. It is the second pillar of Islam and represents a direct connection between the worshipper and Allah. 

### The Five Daily Prayers

The five daily prayers are performed at specific times throughout the day: **Fajr** (dawn prayer before sunrise), **Dhuhr** (midday prayer after the sun passes its zenith), **Asr** (afternoon prayer in late afternoon), **Maghrib** (sunset prayer just after sunset), and **Isha** (night prayer after twilight disappears).

This guide will help you to learn how to perform the salah (worship), related duas (prayers) and dhikrs (supplications).
