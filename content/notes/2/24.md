The Qur'an issues a clear challenge to anyone who doubts it: produce a chapter (surah) like it, even with help from others. Over the centuries people have tried—asking poets, scholars, and collaborators—but none have reproduced its language, style, and depth. This lasting failure is cited as evidence of the Qur'an's inimitability and, for many, of its divine origin.
