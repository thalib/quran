The Quran in verses `2:3-20` categorizes people into three distinct groups based on their belief:

- verses `2:3-5` Believers (الْمُؤْمِنُونَ)
- verses `2:6-7` Disbelievers (الْكَافِرُونَ)
- verses `2:8-20` Hypocrites (المُنَافِقُونَ)


A munafiq (hypocrite) is used to describe a person who outwardly professes faith in Islam but has hypocrisy, either in their heart or actions

The hypocrites share traits with disbelievers but conceal themselves among believers to sow confusion and discord. Their actions and intentions are deceptive, aiming to create division and chaos within the community of believers.

Hence, compared to verses 2:3-5 and 2:6-7, Allah describes their nature and behavior in detail, highlighting their duplicity and the harm they cause to the unity of believers.

`Two types of examples` are given for the hypocrite:

1. Verses 2:17-18 present a hypocrite as someone who kindles a fire, but Allah extinguishes it, leaving them in complete darkness. The hypocrite makes efforts to succeed, but in reality, their efforts are in vain.
2. Verses 2:19-20 describe the state of the hypocrites as being caught in a storm of doubt and uncertainty.
