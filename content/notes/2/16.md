The third type of person is a, **Hypocrites (المُنَافِقُونَ)**, is described in verses `2:8-20`.

A munafiq (hypocrite) outwardly professes faith in Islam while harboring insincerity in their heart or actions. Unlike open disbelievers, hypocrites conceal themselves among believers to sow discord and create division within the Believers (Muslims).

Due to their deceptive nature and the significant threat they pose to believers (Muslims) unity, Allah (God) describes hypocrites in greater detail than believers `2:3-5` or disbelievers `2:6-7`.

Two types of parables illustrate the hypocrites' condition further: verses `2:17-18` and `2:19-20`
