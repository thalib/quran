**_Type 1 Hypocrite_**: A hypocrite kindles a fire seeking guidance, yet Allah extinguishes it, leaving them in complete darkness — their efforts ultimately prove futile.

Powerful words describe this type of hypocrite: they become **willfully deaf, mute, and blind** to the truth. This is not literal physical loss but a spiritual hardening: the heart and senses refuse to accept guidance.

Consider the warning's force: those who persist in rejecting truth are described as people **_they will never return ˹to the Right Path˺_**. This is a solemn reminder that repeated, deliberate rejection of guidance can lead to permanent spiritual loss.

How many moments of light have we ignored because following them required sacrifice? How many chances for mercy did we discard for temporary comfort?

May Allah protect us from becoming like them, grant us sincerity in word and deed, and keep our hearts open to guidance.
