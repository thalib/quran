**_Example 1_**. A hypocrite kindles a fire for guidance, but Allah extinguishes it, leaving them in complete darkness — their efforts ultimately prove futile.

How powerful are the words **"willfully deaf, dumb, and blind."** These people are so adamant, and it is then said that **"they will never return ˹to the Right Path˺."**

May Allah protect us from these types of people and from becoming one of them.
