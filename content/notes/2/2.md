There is a clear connection between Quran verse {{< qurantt v="1:6" >}} and **2:2**. Anyone who begins reading the Quran starts with the first chapter, where they pray to Allah (God) for guidance: _"Guide us along the Straight Path."_ In response to this prayer, verse **2:2** introduces the Quran as a book of guidance for those who seek it. This establishes the Quran as the fulfillment of the request made in **1:6**, offering divine direction to those who are conscious of Allah (God) and sincerely searching for the truth.
