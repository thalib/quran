Have you not ˹already˺ received the stories of those who were before you: the people of Noah, ’Âd, Thamûd, and those after them? Only Allah knows how many they were. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands over their mouths and said, “We totally reject what you have been sent with, and we are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.”
