{{<quran v="99:1-8">}}

This is a very short surah that powerfully and clearly describes the events that will occur before the end of the world and humanity. Its concise words deliver a profound message to the reader of the Quran.

{{< quranhl v="99:1" hl="35-50" >}}
{{< quranhl v="99:2" hl="14-48" >}}

This refers to the final, catastrophic earthquake on the Day of Judgment—unlike any earthquake experienced before. The verse suggests something far beyond natural tectonics, possibly the violent destabilization of the entire earth or even the collapse of planetary systems.

It reminds us that this life is not the end; the earth itself will become a witness and play a role in divine justice. The earth will eject its **contents**—which may include dead bodies, secrets, or records of human deeds. Symbolically, this reflects the earth revealing its layers, fossils, and preserved history, serving as a record of all that has occurred.

{{< quranhl v="99:3" hl="1-46" >}}

People will experience awe, fear, and confusion, questioning the unprecedented chaos. This reflects our natural tendency to seek answers during sudden catastrophes—especially when we lose control. On that Day, even skeptics will recognize a higher power, but it may be too late for repentance.

> This is a wake-up call, challenging us to consider: Are we prepared for a day when even the earth will testify against our actions?

{{< quranhl v="99:4" hl="1-46" >}}
{{< quranhl v="99:5" hl="13-33" >}}

The earth, once a passive witness, will become an active participant in divine justice, testifying to everything that occurred upon it—crimes, good deeds, oppression, prayers, and more.

This will happen by God's command. The Qur'an teaches that God's inspiration (“wahy”) is not limited to humans; He inspired the bee {{< qurantt v="16:68" >}} and the heavens {{< qurantt v="41:12" >}} as well.

Our actions—even those hidden or long forgotten—are recorded. At the final hour, by God's decree, the earth will reveal all that was concealed.

{{< quranhl v="99:6" hl="36-96" >}}
{{< quranhl v="99:7" hl="17-55" >}}
{{< quranhl v="99:8" hl="18-55" >}}

Humanity will be divided according to the weight of their deeds, witnessing the true consequences of their actions. This highlights divine justice and accountability, as people are separated and assembled in groups for judgment.

Even the smallest act—good or bad—will be acknowledged and judged. The term "atom" (dharrah) referred to the tiniest known particle in ancient times; today, we know of even smaller particles, but the metaphor remains powerful.

This teaches that nothing is insignificant. Small acts of kindness or harm accumulate over time, much like our digital footprints. Every action, no matter how minor, is recorded and will be brought to light.
