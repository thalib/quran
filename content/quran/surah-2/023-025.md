{{< quran v="2:23-25" >}}

Verse ***v2:23*** challenges those who are in doubt and refuse to accept God's book to produce a surah (chapter) like it, and to seek help from others besides Allah.


Verse ***v2:24*** reinforces that no one will ever be able to produce anything like a chapter of the Quran, and warns that those who disbelieve will face punishment (they will be the fuel of Hellfire along with stones). ***v2:25*** then brings good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds: they will be granted Gardens beneath which rivers flow, enjoy abundant fruits, and reside there eternally with their spouses.
