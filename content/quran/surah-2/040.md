Allah reminds the Children of Israel of His favors and calls them to fulfill their covenant, then reminds them of several instances from the past. The Quran confirms earlier scriptures, warning against rejecting divine revelations for worldly benefits and emphasizing faithful adherence to divine guidance.

The following commands may look to be directed towards the Children of Israel (Jews), but they apply to all Muslims as well.

Verse 2:49 clarifies that what befell the Children of Israel was a divinely ordained trial: `"That was a severe test from your Lord."` The description stresses both the gravity of the events (liberation, hardship, and the consequences of disobedience) and their purpose — to test faith, patience, and moral resolve. For readers today the verse is a reminder that trials may serve to distinguish sincere submission from mere appearance, and that endurance, gratitude, and adherence to covenantal obligations are the appropriate responses.

A key moment is 2:61, when the Jews asked to replace the heavenly provision (manna and quails) with ordinary earthly foods — `herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions` — thereby exchanging that which is better (a divinely given, sustaining blessing) for that which is worse (transient, worldly food).
