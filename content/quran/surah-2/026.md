{{< quran v="2:26" >}}


This verse highlights that Allah uses even the smallest of examples, like a mosquito, to convey profound truths. Believers recognize the wisdom in such parables, while disbelievers question their meaning. Through these examples, Allah guides those open to faith and lets those who are rebellious go astray, emphasizing that guidance and misguidance are both within His wisdom.
