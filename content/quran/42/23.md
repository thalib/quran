That ˹reward˺ is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who believe and do good. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you for a reward for this ˹message˺—only honour for ˹our˺ kinship.” Whoever earns a good deed, We will increase it in goodness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
