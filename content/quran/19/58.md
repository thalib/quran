Those were ˹some of˺ the prophets who Allah has blessed from among the descendants of Adam, and of those We carried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and of those We guided and chose. Whenever the revelations of the Most Compassionate were recited to them, they fell down, prostrating and weeping.
