He is the One Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot, then He brings you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime, and become old—though some of you ˹may˺ die sooner—reaching an appointed time, so perhaps you may understand ˹Allah’s power˺.
