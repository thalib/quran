Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen the hypocrites who say to their fellow disbelievers from the People of the Book, “If you are expelled, we will certainly leave with you, and We will never obey anyone against you. And if you are fought against, we will surely help you.”? But Allah bears witness that they are truly liars.
