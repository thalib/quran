You are not responsible for people’s guidance ˹O Prophet˺—it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills. Whatever you ˹believers˺ spend in charity, it is for your own good—as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of Allah. Whatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
