When you divorce women and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not ˹let the guardians˺ prevent them from re-marrying their ex-husbands if they come to an honourable agreement. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. This is purer and more dignifying for you. Allah knows and you do not know.
