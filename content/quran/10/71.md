Relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Noah when he said to his people, “O my People! If my presence and my reminders to you of Allah’s signs are unbearable to you, then ˹know that˺ I have put my trust in Allah. So devise a plot along with your associate-gods—and you do not have to be secretive about your plot—then carry it out against me without delay!
