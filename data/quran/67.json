    "1": "Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent -",
    "2": "[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving -",
    "3": "[And] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks?",
    "4": "Then return [your] vision twice again. [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued.",
    "5": "And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made [from] them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.",
    "6": "And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination.",
    "7": "When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful] inhaling while it boils up.",
    "8": "It almost bursts with rage. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, Did there not come to you a warner?",
    "9": "They will say, Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied and said, 'Allah has not sent down anything. You are not but in great error.'",
    "10": "And they will say, If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.",
    "11": "And they will admit their sin, so [it is] alienation for the companions of the Blaze.",
    "12": "Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward.",
    "13": "And conceal your speech or publicize it; indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.",
    "14": "Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?",
    "15": "It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision - and to Him is the resurrection.",
    "16": "Do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway?",
    "17": "Or do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones? Then you would know how [severe] was My warning.",
    "18": "And already had those before them denied, and how [terrible] was My reproach.",
    "19": "Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and [sometimes] folded in? None holds them [aloft] except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is, of all things, Seeing.",
    "20": "Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the Most Merciful? The disbelievers are not but in delusion.",
    "21": "Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion.",
    "22": "Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path?",
    "23": "Say, It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.",
    "24": "Say, It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.",
    "25": "And they say, When is this promise, if you should be truthful?",
    "26": "Say, The knowledge is only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.",
    "27": "But when they see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed, and it will be said, This is that for which you used to call.",
    "28": "Say, [O Muhammad], Have you considered: whether Allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us, who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?",
    "29": "Say, He is the Most Merciful; we have believed in Him, and upon Him we have relied. And you will [come to] know who it is that is in clear error.",
    "30": "Say, Have you considered: if your water was to become sunken [into the earth], then who could bring you flowing water?"
