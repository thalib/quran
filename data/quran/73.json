    "1": "O you who wraps himself [in clothing],",
    "2": "Arise [to pray] the night, except for a little -",
    "3": "Half of it - or subtract from it a little",
    "4": "Or add to it, and recite the Qur'an with measured recitation.",
    "5": "Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word.",
    "6": "Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue] and more suitable for words.",
    "7": "Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation.",
    "8": "And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion.",
    "9": "[He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of [your] affairs.",
    "10": "And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance.",
    "11": "And leave Me with [the matter of] the deniers, those of ease [in life], and allow them respite a little.",
    "12": "Indeed, with Us [for them] are shackles and burning fire",

    "20": "Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muhammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allah determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur'an. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
