    "4": "And We did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree.",
    "5": "No nation will precede its term, nor will they remain thereafter.",
    "6": "And they say, O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad.",
    "7": "Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among the truthful?",
    "8": "We do not send down the angels except with truth; and the disbelievers would not then be reprieved.",
    "9": "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.",
    "10": "And We had certainly sent [messengers] before you, [O Muhammad], among the sects of the former peoples.",
    "11": "And no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him.",
    "12": "Thus do We insert denial into the hearts of the criminals.",
    "13": "They will not believe in it, while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples.",
    "14": "And [even] if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continued therein to ascend,",
    "15": "They would say, Our eyes have only been dazzled. Rather, we are a people affected by magic.",
    "16": "And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers.",
    "17": "And We have protected it from every devil expelled [from the mercy of Allah]",
    "18": "Except one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear burning flame.",
    "19": "And the earth - We have spread it and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every well-balanced thing.",
    "20": "And We have made for you therein means of living and [for] those for whom you are not providers.",
    "21": "And there is not a thing but that with Us are its depositories, and We do not send it down except according to a known measure.",
    "22": "And We have sent the fertilizing winds and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it. And you are not its retainers.",
    "23": "And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritor.",
    "24": "And We have already known the preceding [generations] among you, and We have already known the later [ones to come].",
    "25": "And indeed, your Lord will gather them; indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.",
    "26": "And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud.",
    "27": "And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.",
    "28": "And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, I will create a human being out of clay from an altered black mud.",
    "29": "And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration.",
    "30": "So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely,",
    "31": "Except Iblees, he refused to be with those who prostrated.",
    "32": "[Allah] said, O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?",
    "33": "He said, Never would I prostrate to a human whom You created out of clay from an altered black mud.",

    "39": "[Iblees] said, My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all",
    "40": "Except, among them, Your chosen servants.",
    "41": "[Allah] said, This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.",
    "42": "Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.",
    "43": "And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.",
    "44": "It has seven gates; for every gate is of them a portion designated.",
    "45": "Indeed, the righteous will be within gardens and springs.",
    "46": "[Having been told], Enter it in peace, safe [and secure].",
    "47": "And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, [so they will be] brothers, on thrones facing each other.",

    "50": "And that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment.",
    "51": "And inform them about the guests of Abraham,",
    "52": "When they entered upon him and said, Peace. [Abraham] said, Indeed, we are fearful of you.",
    "53": "[The angels] said, Fear not. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a learned boy.",
    "54": "He said, Have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me? Then of what [wonder] do you inform?",
    "55": "They said, We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not be of the despairing.",
    "56": "He said, And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?",
    "57": "[Abraham] said, Then what is your business [here], O messengers?",
    "58": "They said, Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals,",
    "59": "Except the family of Lot; indeed, we will save them all",
    "60": "Except his wife. Allah decreed that she is of those who remain behind.",
    "61": "And when the messengers came to the family of Lot,",
    "62": "He said, Indeed, you are people unknown.",
    "63": "They said, But we have come to you with that about which they were disputing,",
    "64": "And we have come to you with truth, and indeed, we are truthful.",
    "65": "So set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded.",
    "66": "And We conveyed to him [the decree] of that matter: that those [sinners] would be eliminated by early morning.",
    "67": "And the people of the city came rejoicing.",
    "68": "[Lot] said, Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.",
    "69": "And fear Allah and do not disgrace me.",
    "70": "They said, Have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?",
    "71": "[Lot] said, These are my daughters - if you would be doers [of lawful marriage].",
    "72": "By your life, [O Muhammad], indeed they were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly.",
    "73": "So the shriek seized them at sunrise.",
    "74": "And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay.",
    "75": "Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.",
    "76": "And indeed, those cities are [situated] on an established road.",
    "77": "Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.",
    "78": "And the companions of the thicket were [also] wrongdoers.",
    "79": "So We took retribution from them, and indeed, both [cities] are on a clear highway.",
    "80": "And certainly did the companions of Thamud deny the messengers.",
    "81": "And We gave them Our signs, but from them they were turning away.",
    "82": "And they used to carve from the mountains, houses, feeling secure.",
    "83": "But the shriek seized them at early morning.",
    "84": "So nothing availed them [from] what they used to earn.",
    "85": "And We have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth. And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.",
    "86": "Indeed, your Lord - He is the Knowing Creator.",
    "87": "And We have certainly given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Qur'an.",
    "88": "Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [certain] categories of the disbelievers, and do not grieve over them. And lower your wing to the believers",
    "89": "And say, Indeed, I am the clear warner -",
    "90": "Just as We had revealed [scriptures] to the separators",
    "91": "Who have made the Qur'an into portions.",
    "92": "So by your Lord, We will surely question them all",
    "93": "About what they used to do.",
    "94": "Then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists.",
    "95": "Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers",
    "96": "Who make [equal] with Allah another deity. But they are going to know.",
    "97": "And We already know that your breast is constrained by what they say.",
    "98": "So exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and be of those who prostrate [to Him].",
    "99": "And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty (death)."
