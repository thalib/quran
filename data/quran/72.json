    "1": "Say, [O Muhammad], It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an.",
    "2": "It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.",
    "3": "And [it teaches] that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son",
    "4": "And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression.",
    "5": "And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie.",
    "6": "And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden.",
    "7": "And they had thought, as you thought, that Allah would never send anyone [as a messenger].",
    "8": "And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.",
    "9": "And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.",
    "10": "And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course.",
    "11": "And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.",
    "12": "And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.",
    "13": "And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden.",
    "14": "And among us are Muslims [in submission to Allah], and among us are the unjust. And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course.",
    "15": "But as for the unjust, they will be, for Hell, firewood.'",
    "16": "And [Allah revealed] that if they had remained straight on the way, We would have given them abundant provision",
    "17": "So We might test them therein. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord He will put into arduous punishment.",
    "18": "And [He revealed] that the masjids are for Allah, so do not invoke with Allah anyone.",
    "19": "And that when the Servant of Allah stood up supplicating Him, they almost became about him a compacted mass.",
    "20": "Say, [O Muhammad], I only invoke my Lord and do not associate with Him anyone.",
    "21": "Say, Indeed, I do not possess for you [the power of] harm or right direction.",
    "22": "Say, Indeed, there will never protect me from Allah anyone [if I should disobey], nor will I find in other than Him a refuge.",
    "23": "But [I have for you] only notification from Allah, and His messages. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, for him is the fire of Hell; they will abide therein forever.",
    "24": "[The disbelievers continue] until, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number.",
    "25": "Say, I do not know if what you are promised is near or if my Lord will grant for it a [long] period.",
    "26": "[He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone",
    "27": "Except whom He has approved of messengers, and indeed, He sends before each messenger and behind him observers",
    "28": "That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number."
